The ACLU filed a lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday challenging the Biden administration new executive actions that block migrants from seeking asylum at the southern U.S. border when crossings surge. Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney for the ACLU, told NPR that President Biden new measures are nearly identical from a legal standpoint to ones that former President Donald Trump used to try to ban migrants from seeking asylum between ports of entry.
